If user does not follow anyone, show 50 posts from random users

FIX FOLLOW
    Get list of all followers
    Check if list contains UID of user that you want to check
    when a user follows / unfollows a user -> add to / remove from list as required

Research on messenger how to set up etc
    conversations (collection)
